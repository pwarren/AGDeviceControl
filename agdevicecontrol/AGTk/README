This is a first crude attempt to integrate AGDeviceControl with the
Access Grid Toolkit version 2.3. 

AGTk has two types of application, node-service and shared-app. Node
services is a fairly simple launcher system capable of firing up an
external app (such as vic or rat) whenever a new Venue is entered.
Shared Apps is more about collaboration between AG participants.  A
Shared App similarly fires up an external app but also provides an
event channel and a common data store through which different
instances of the Shared App can communicate.  Unfortunately the Shared
App isn't run automagically when entering a Venue.  Instead it must
(i) be launched manually and (ii) must exist as a separate instance in
each Venue.

We want a node service plus the event channel and data store of the
Shared App.  

Node Services are packaged as a zip archive.  To install the service,
we use the agpm.py (AG Package Manager) tool.  This simply copies the
archive to the correct directory
(/Applications/AccessGridToolkit.app/Contents/Resources/NodeServices
on MacOSX, for example).

- DeviceControlService.py is run each time we switch Venues

- Our service is going to have the following functionality
    - maintain state about current Venue
    - keep track of other instances running on remote nodes in the
      same Venue
    - be a raw AGDeviceControl-like GUI client
    - be a RoomServer configured to aggregate several DeviceServers
